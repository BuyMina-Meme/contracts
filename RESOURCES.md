1. An integer approximation of (\_baseN / \_baseD) ^ (\_expN / \_expD) \* 2 ^ precision
2. Continuous Token Price = Reserve Token Balance / (Continuous Token Supply x Reserve Ratio)
3. A common challenge in creating successful token-based communities is reaching a critical barrier where there are enough market participants to reach a liquid, healthy exchange of value.

In general, all bonding curves are susceptible to manipulation, like pump and dump schemes. There are several ways to mitigate these attacks. Most of them have to do with forcing some sort of time-lock on selling tokens, or charging a premium for selling.
